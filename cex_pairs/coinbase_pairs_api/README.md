1. Install Homebrew: `$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
2. Install Python: `$ brew install python`
3. Confirm that Python was installed and check your version: `python --version`
4. Install Pandas: `pip3 install pandas`
5. Install Requests: `pip3 install requests`
6. Some users may also have to install the Six module: `pip3 install six`

**Note, if you aren't using Python3 then use the `pip` command instead of `pip3` when installing modules**
