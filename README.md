## Installation

_Instructions for installation project and setting up the development environment:_

Take the following steps to get your environment up and running:

_Mac Users_

1. Install Homebrew:
   `$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
2. Install Python: `$ brew install python`
3. Confirm that Python was installed and check your version: `python --version`

_Linux Users_

If you are using **Ubuntu 16.10 or newer**, open your command line prompt and run the following:

1. `$ sudo apt-get update`
2. `$ sudo apt-get install python3.6`

If you are using **another version of Ubuntu**, open your command line prompt and run the following:

1. `$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common`
2. `$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
3. `$ sudo apt-get update`
4. `$ sudo apt-get install python3.8`

If you are using **another Linux distrubution**, you likely already have Python pre-installed. If not, use your distributionâ€™s package manager. For example on Fedora, you would use dnf in the command line:

1. `$ sudo dnf install python3`

_Windows Users_

Windows users can refer to this **[link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/installing-python-on-windows/)** for instructions on installing Python.

_Libraries_

Each script requires its own set of libraries that must be installed to successfully retreive the data. The most consistently used ones include:

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

To install the libraries above, or any of the required ones, run `pip install [LIBRARY NAME]` in your environment once it is up and running. If you are using Python3, run `pip3 install [LIBRARY NAME]`
