# Alternative Real World Asset Protocols

The protocols covered here include those operating in the real world private credit space. They are tracked by DeFiLlama in other categories, but can be considered RWAs depending how you look at it.

Add the values here to your RWA analysis to for a more hollistic look at on-chain RWAs.

See [centrifuge_by_chain_type.py](https://github.com/check-sked/crypto_data_resources/blob/main/alternative_rwa/centrifuge_by_chain_type.py) for comments on individual protocol script functionality.
