# Dune Analytics API

- Use this python script to retrieve data from Dune queries.
- File returned will look like the table of the query requested. For example, the CSV file returned of [this query](https://dune.com/queries/4319/22558) will have four columns (Rank, Project, 7 Days Volume, and 24 Hours Volume) and 47 rows (one row for each rank).

**User must input their API in the " " marks of line 15.**

_Reference [here](https://github.com/check-sked/dune_analytics_api) for the script in Node.JS._
